### ***The Resistor Calculator program***

The Resistor Calculator program was developed to calculate the ResistorValue, once you input the values for the following; supply voltage, forward voltage and lastly the rated current you would be able to calculate the resistor value. The following is some test data you can use to test the program.

| Supply VOltage | Forward Voltage of LED | Rated Current | Program Result           |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------ |
| 9              | 1.8                    | 20            | 0.36 ohms resistor       |
| 5              | -4                     | 0.001         | 9000.8 ohms resistor     |
| 3.3            | -4.5                   | 0             | Infinity ohms resistor   |
| 5v             | 2v                     | 20.5mA        | 0.15 ohms resistor       |


Feel free to use your own test data to have a go at calculating the ohms resistor value.
